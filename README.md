### Usage Example

Ask Hermit a question using the `ponder` command.

```bash
‚ùØ hermit ponder "Does a tower truly exist if its only occupant is a sorcerer who never leaves?"

Starting thought...

*Does the tower hold sway over the sorcerer's essence, or does the sorcerer's mere presence animate the tower into being,
and thus do we ponder: Is it the tower that exists, or is it merely the sorcerer's own echo?*
```
